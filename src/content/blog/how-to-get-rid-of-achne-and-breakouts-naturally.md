 <p>Skin is a window to what is going on inside of your body.
        Acne may be a sign of several issues that the body is maybe dealing with. And can be a warning sign of hormonal disbalances, elevated blood sugar levels, poor immunity, and vitamin and mineral deficiencies.
 <p>All of these conditions can lead to serious health conditions if left untreated.
  <p>Let's look at the cause of acne to understand why they happen and how to treat them.</p>
    <h2>What Causes Acne</h2>
 <p> 1. Hormonal disbalance. Increased testosterone, and other androgens (androgens belong to a family of testosterone ) can cause increased oil production, also known as sebum. The sebum mixes with dead skin cells and gets stuck in the pores.</p>
<p> 2. Bacterial overgrowth - cutie bacterium and its proliferation causes inflammation, immune cells come in and attach the bacteria. This process also causes acne.</p>
  <p> 3. High glycemic diet - exacerbates all health conditions and concerns including acne.</p>
   <p> High glycemic diets can either  cause acne or exacerbate the existing acne and breakouts.</p>

   <p>High glycemic diet includes carbohydrates that are fast digesting and therefore raise blood sugar and insulin as a result.</p>
 <p> 4. Insulin and IGF-I are involved in regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation. It can trigger skin cell proliferation that can clog up the pores.  It can also enlarge the oil gland resulting in more oil production.</p>
 <p> 5. Lack of curtain nutrients may cause acne. A 2013 study  investigated the blood levels of zinc, vitamin A, and vitamin E in people with and without acne. The researchers found that the levels of all of these vitamins and minerals were significantly lower in the people with acne.</p>
 <p> 6. Lack of vitamin D has a strong association with acne. Vitamin D helps regulate hormones and blood sugar levels which in turn help to treat and prevent acne.</p>
 <p> 7.There is a genetic component to acne. Twin studies suggest 81% association with acne
        Some people have a reaction to milk. Try to avoid milk and see if your acne will improve. Choose cheese, yogurt, and kefir instead</p>
