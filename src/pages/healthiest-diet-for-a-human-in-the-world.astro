<p>Have you ever been captivated by the radiant vitality from seemingly ageless individuals? Did you ever wonder what their secrets might be? I've been probing this very question with people who seem to defy the passage of time for quite some time now. Their responses have varied greatly: abstaining from sugar, incorporating supplements, indulging in facials, embracing a vegan diet, and staying physically active, among other things.</p>

<p>Now that I'm 41, people are turning the question back on me. There have been instances where some mistook my son for my brother, and now that he's taller than me, queries have surfaced about whether I'm his girlfriend, all due to my appearance. It always brings a smile to my face, affirming that my lifestyle choices are paying off. Though I wish I could encapsulate my personal secret in a single phrase, the truth is a lot more intricate.</p>

<h2>My Personal Secrets of Health and Vitality</h2>
<p>My personal secrets are deeply embedded in a holistic blend of diet, exercise, circadian rhythm optimization, stress management, and internal work that has reshaped my self-belief, previously molded by my surrounding environment.</p>

<p>Of these elements, the belief system plays a paramount role, acting as the catalyst for all the other practices. I firmly believe in my ability to choose robust health without chronic diseases. I have an unwavering confidence that these choices will keep me strong, slim, youthful, and happy. These strong beliefs reshape my old habits and spring me into daily actions encompassing exercise, research on health and longevity, dedication to a restful sleep and stress management.</p>

<p>Diet, being the major aspect of a lifestyle, took a lot of reshaping. It required a complete deconstruction of my dietary patterns, selective retention of the beneficial components, and incorporation of missing elements leaving out foods that do not serve my body and can rob me of my health and longevity.</p>

<h2>What is the Healthiest Diet For a Human?</h2>

<p>Some time back, I set out on a journey to uncover the ideal diet for optimum health. The diet that not only keeps my body healthy and functional, but also can potentially reverse the signs of aging and/ or significantly slow it down. I feel I did succeed in this pursuit. My exploration revealed that the concept of the world's healthiest diet remains a highly controversial topic. The debate rages on, with proponents championing ketogenic, gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian, carnivore, and mediterranean diets. This topic creates a lot of heated discussions and frankly I am not sure why.</p>

<p>The answer to this hotly debatable question should be simple and straightforward. The healthiest diet in the world is the one that provides the body with all essential nutrients while causing the least harm.</p>

<p>Perplexed by the question of what is the healthiest diet I spent countless hours immersed in literature and scientific studies analyzing the information and putting it all together. My persistent efforts culminated in the creation of My Best Diet, a meticulously curated list of foods and supplements that now constitute the cornerstone of my dietary regimen. This is hands down the healthiest diet in the world FOR ME.</p>

<h2> A Word of Caution</h2>
<p>I am not a qualified nutritionist or a medical practitioner, and I do not endorse any specific diet for others. I simply share knowledge that is readily available through scientific studies, literature, and the internet. My insights stem from personal experiences, and while it would be intriguing to witness how this diet, or a variation of it, affects others, I encourage individuals to approach it as their own personal experiment at their own risk.</p>

<p>I named this dietary approach 'My Best Diet' for a reasonâ€”it was crafted by me, for me. If you wish to try it, you can adopt the entire regimen or just some elements and customize it to your preferences, using yourself as the ultimate test subject. However, every item on the list holds a specific purpose, and any omissions are deliberate and backed by rationale.</p>


<h2>Results I achieved on My Best Diet</h2>

<p> Below are my personal measured success. I am not claiming that others will achieve similar results or will not achieve better once. I am also not claiming that other diets do not yield results. None the less, My Best Diet worked great for Me.</p>
<p> &bull; I successfully maintain my body fat, currently at 15.8%, a figure even considered excellent for women aged 21 to 25, despite being 41 years old.</p>
    <p> &bull; My visceral fat stands at 29.6 cm2, a measurement comparable to that of a 20-year-old female, indicating exceptional health for my age.</p>
           <p> &bull; My skeletal muscle mass amounts to 53.4 lbs, constituting 46% of my total body weight (114.3 lbs)</p>
           <p> &bull; I no longer feel sluggish, experiencing a newfound vibrancy and vitality</p>
           <p> &bull; This diet supplies me with more energy than any other diet I've previously experimented with</p>
           <p> &bull; I am able to stay physically fit and preserve my muscle mass while consuming fewer calories, a practice known to promote longevity</p>
           <p> &bull; It has enhanced my sleep quality, ensuring a more restful and rejuvenating experience</p>
          <p> &bull; I constantly feel satiated and nourished even with a reduced calorie intake. Managing calorie consumption is crucial in preventing accelerated aging</p>
          <p> &bull; I appear younger than my peers</p>
           <p> &bull; I maintain a low inflammation score and exhibit low cellular senescence, a critical marker of aging (tested with <a title="Test your microbiome with Viome - discount code" href="https://viomehq.sjv.io/rnm9rv"><b>Viome</b></a>)</p>
            <p> &bull; I have high immunity (tested with TruDiagnostics)</p>
     <p> &bull; And the best part, I look great in mini dresses</p>

<h2>Transforming The Healthiest Diet into a Way of Life</h2>

<p>Although various diets and exercise plans can produce comparable outcomes, several crucial aspects often remain unaddressed. One significant shortcoming of many diets is the deficiency or excess of certain nutrients, making the long-term adoption of these diets challenging without consequent side effects.</p>
<p>"My Best Diet" is meticulously balanced, encompassing all essential nutrients required by the body while deliberately omitting excessive nutrients that can potentially slow down the system and accelerate the aging process.</p>


<h2>The Benefits of My Best Diet On a Deeper Level</h2>

                 <p> &bull; Corrects nutritional deficiencies</p>
                   <p> &bull; Regulates Mtor activity to promote longevity</p>
                          <p> &bull; Protects DNA from damage and mutations</p>
                           <p> &bull; Provides protection from UVB/UVA radiation</p>
                           <p> &bull; Protects from cancer and various chronic illnesses</p>
                           <p> &bull; Balances out hormones</p>
                           <p> &bull; Reduces inflammation and cellular senescence. Yes, I stated this before, but low inflammation score is a big deal</p>
                           <p> &bull; Supports beneficial DNA methylation</p>
                           <p> &bull; Extends life</p>

<h2>Foods I do My Best To Consume Every Day</h2>

    <p><b>Pumpkin seeds </b>- nutrient loaded superfood.</p>

    <p><b>Sunflower seeds</b> - nutrient loaded superfood.</p>

    <p><b>White button mushrooms, shiitake, maitake</b> - aside from other nutrients mushrooms contain ergothioneine, an amino acid that acts as a powerful antioxidant, even more powerful than our endogenous glutathione.

<h2>Other General Rules For My Best Diet</h2>

                             <p> &bull; My last meal for the day is between 4 to 6pm. This helps body to detox better during sleep, and have more restful sleep as well.</p>
                             <p> &bull; I do not eat meat, fish, and anything that had brain, blood, and a beating heart in it. This is a personal choice. However, meat consumption have been associated with cardiovascular problems and overactive mTor. Overactive mTor pathway ages the body faster.</p>
                            <p> &bull; My first meal is typically around 10 am.</p>
                             <p> &bull; I exercise before my first meal.</p>
                             <p> &bull; I suntan to raise the only nutrient I can not get from food - vitamin D. This is controversial, however, the right diet can protect DNA from UV radiation. The vitamin D from the supplements is not the same as from the sun.</p>
                             <p> &bull; I stick to this diet 95% of the time. I deviate here and there and may snack on some things like macaroons, or eat popcorn. And I donâ€™t give myself a hard time, I enjoy my little deviation.</p>
